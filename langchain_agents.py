"""
Multi-Agent Medical Team Discussion System using LangChain

This module creates a simulated medical team discussion about a patient with 
interstitial lung disease (ILD), with each agent representing a different medical specialty.
The discussion format is modeled after the ILD multidisciplinary meeting.
